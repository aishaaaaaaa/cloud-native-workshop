# Lab Guide - Pods, Deployments and Services

## Exercise 1 - Pods
A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster - it's the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. 

### Steps

#### Creating and updating Pods

1. Using ```kubectl```, create a new Pod called 'webserver' running ```nginx``` image.

    ```bash
    kubectl run webserver --image=nginx --restart=Never
    ```

1. Get the status and IP of Pod 'webserver'.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pod webserver -o wide 
    ```

1. Get a detailed description of the pod, including related resources such as events or controllers.

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod webserver
    ```

1. Intentionally deploy a faulty Pod:

    ```bash
    kubectl run faultywebserver --image=nnginx --restart=Never
    ```

1. Get the status of 'faultywebserver'.

    ```
    kubectl get pod faultywebserver -o wide 
    ```

    > Notice that the Pod status is "ImagePullBackOff". Something is wrong.

1. Identify, and resolve, the issue with 'faultywebserver'.
    
    ```
    kubectl describe pod faultywebserver | grep "Warning"
    kubectl set image pod faultywebserver faultywebserver=nginx
    kubectl get pod faultywebserver -o wide
    ```

1. Using YAML, create a new Pod called 'web' running ```nginx``` image.

    ```
    # use kubectl to generate web-pod.yaml
    kubectl run webserver-yaml --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run -o yaml > web-pod.yaml

    # view nginx-pod.yaml
    cat web-pod.yaml
    
    # apply the YAML file
    kubectl apply -f web-pod.yaml
    ```
    
    > Notice the use of ```--dry-run -o yaml``` to generate the yaml, which is then piped into web-pod.yaml. 

#### Labels and annotations

1. Using ```kubectl```, create a new Pod called 'nginx-with-labels' running ```nginx``` image. Label the Pod with 'app=v1'.

    ```bash
    kubectl run nginx-with-labels --image=nginx --restart=Never --labels=app=v1
    
    # or

    kubectl run nginx-with-labels --image=nginx --restart=Never
    kubectl label pod nginx-with-labels app=v1
    ```

1. Show all Pods in the default namespace, including the Pods' labels.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pod --show-labels
    ```

1. Show a specific Pod, with it's labels:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods nginx-with-labels --show-labels
    ```

1. Change the label of pod 'nginx' to be 'app=v2'

    ```bash
    kubectl label pod nginx-with-labels app=v2 --overwrite
    ```

1. Get all Pods with the label 'app=v2'.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -l app=v2
    ```

1. Remove the 'app' label from Pod 'nginx-with-labels'.

    ```bash
    kubectl label pod nginx-with-labels app-
    ``` 

1. Annotate Pod 'nginx-with-labels' with "description='my description'".

    ```bash
    kubectl annotate pod nginx-with-labels description='my description'
    ```

#### Logs and Exec 

1. Get logs from 'webserver'.

    ```
    kubectl logs webserver 
    ```

1. Retrieve a list of all the files within the ```nginx``` container running on 'webserver' pod.

    ```
    kubectl exec webserver -- ls
    ```

## Exercise 2 - ReplicaSets
In this Exercise, you will create a ReplicaSet, which will ensure that there are always specified number of Pods running in the cluster.

### Creating Pods though a ReplicaSets

1. Take a look at 'ng-rc.yaml'

    ```bash
    code ./assets/lab-02/ng-rc.yaml
    ```

1. Use ```kubectl apply``` to create the ReplicaSet

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./assets/lab-02/ng-rc.yaml
    ```

1. Run the following command to see two new Pods created by the ReplicaSet:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l target=dev --show-labels
    ```

### Testing the ReplicaSets
With the Pods up and running, you will check if the ReplicaSet controller is working as expected. You will do that by removing the label (**target**) from one of Pods created by the ReplicaSet. This should immediately make ReplicaSet spin up a new Pod since **matchLabels** criteria demands a minimum two Pods with the label (**target=dev**).  

1. Remove the label from one of the deployed Pods (with label "target=dev"):

    ```bash
    kubectl label pod <POD-NAME> target-
    ```

1. Run the following command to see one new Pod created by the ReplicaSet, while an old Pod is still running:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --show-labels
    ```

1. You can delete the additional Pod manually, but a better way to do that is by assigning the (**target=dev**) label back to the Pod. This will make the ReplicaSet terminate one of the Pods to ensure that the total Pod count remains as two (and not three).

    ```bash
    kubectl label pod <POD-NAME> target=dev
    ```

1. Get pods again to see the third Pod being terminated.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --show-labels
    ```

1. Delete the ReplicaSet:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete rs nginx-replica-set
    ```

    > This will delete not only the ReplicaSet, but also all the Pods that it was controlling by using the matching label criteria. 

## Exercise 3 - Deployments
A deployment is an API object that manages a replicated application. A *Deployment controller* provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

### Steps

1. Create a yaml file for a Deployment running a ```nginx``` container and save it as mydeploy.yaml.

    ```bash
    kubectl create deployment mydeploy --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml > mydeploy.yaml 
    ```

    > This is another great example where you can use ```--dry-run -o yaml``` to generate the required yaml.

1. Edit 'mydeploy.yaml' to have 5 replicas

    ```bash
    code ./mydeploy.yaml
    ```

1. Create a Deployment using mydeploy.yaml.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f mydeploy.yaml
    ```

1. View the Deployment 'mydeploy', the associated ReplicaSet and Pods.

    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment,rs,pod
    ```

1. Modify the image used by 'mydeploy' to use image ```nginx:1.16.0``` and observe the update as it's applied.

    ```bash
    # set the deployment image
    kubectl set image deployment mydeploy nginx=nginx:1.16.0

    # observe how the update gets applied 
    kubectl get rs -w
    ```

1. View the rollout history for 'mydeploy' and roll back to the previous revision.

    ```bash
    # view previous rollout revisions and configurations.
    kubectl rollout history deploy mydeploy
    
    # rollback to the previous rollout.
    kubectl rollout undo deploy mydeploy
    
    # observe how rollowing update gets applied 
    kubectl get rs -w
    ```

1. Scale 'mydeploy' to 2 instance. 

    ```
    kubectl scale deploy mydeploy --replicas=2
    ```

## Exercise 3 - Services
A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods.

### Steps

1. Expose the deployment 'mydeploy' on port **80**. Observe that a service is created.

    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment mydeploy --port 80
    kubectl get svc mydeploy
    ```

1. Using the Pod's Cluster IP, create a new temporary Pod using ```busybox``` and 'hit' the IP with ```wget```:

    ```bash
    # get the service's Cluster IP
    kubectl get svc mydeploy -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
    
    # run busybox
    kubectl run busybox --rm --image=busybox -it --restart=Never -- sh

    # from inside the container
    wget -O- <cluster-ip>:80
    exit
    ```

1. Change to service type of 'mydeploy' from the ClusterIP to LoadBalancer. Find the Public IP address and browse to the application.

    ```bash
    # edit the service
    kubectl edit svc mydeploy

    # change "type: ClusterIP" to "type: LoadBalancer"

    # get the assigned external IP
    kubectl get svc -w
    ```

    > **Note:** This may take a few minutes to complete.
